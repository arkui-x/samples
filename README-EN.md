# ArkUI-X App Samples

## Welcome
Thank you for following the ArkUI-X project. Your contribution to this project will be highly appreciated. If you want to submit code samples or demos, go to the [Samples](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/samples) repository. Thank you again for your support.

### Introduction
This repository provides a series of app samples to help you quickly learn the APIs and development process of the ArkUI-X project. Each app sample is an independent cross-platform application project. By using the code editor or [CLI](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli) development tool to browse code, build projects, and install and run app samples, you'll be able to familiarize yourself with the ArkUI cross-platform application development process.

### App Samples

- Basic app:
  - ['HelloWorld': HelloWorld (API8)](HelloWorld)
- Featured apps:
  - ['Shopping': Shopping App (API8)](Shopping)
  - ['HealthyDiet': Healthy Diet App (API8)](HealthyDiet)

## Directory Structure
 

```

|---HelloWorld          # HelloWorld
|---Shopping            # Shopping app
|---HealthyDiet         # Healthy diet app
```

## Constraints

When contributing an app sample, make sure that it meets the project structure requirements of ArkUI-X Command Line Tools, as well as the application project build and packaging requirements, such as package signing, of the OS platform.

## How to Use

1.  Run the [Repo](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/manifest/blob/master/README-EN.md) commands to download all repositories of the ArkUI-X project or download the desired app samples.
2.  Go to the directory that houses the desired sample, for example, **HelloWorld**, and run the [CLI](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli) commands to build a cross-platform application.
3.  Install and run the application. In this way, you can view the effect on devices running different OS platforms.
